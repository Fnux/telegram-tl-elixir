# Telegram-TL

This library allows you to serialize and deserialize elements of the
[TL Language](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL). It was originally
designed to be used by
[telegram-mt-elixir](https://github.com/Fnux/telegram-mt-elixir).

The documentation is available [here (not yet available)](#).
